- 👋 Hi, I’m @wannabeyourfriend
- 🌱 I’m a second-year students@THU with a major of Basic Science of Mathematics and Physics（数理基础科学）, and a minor of computer science. I'm interested in ML, CV and robotics.
- 💞️ I’m currently learning/self-learning deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics.
- 👀 I’m looking for opportunities to participate in reserch on ML, CV, AIGC, embodied AI and so on ...
- 📫 How to reach me. email:`wang-zx23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn`
- 😄 I look forward to communicating and connecting with any students or professors with background related to AI. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!
- Fun fact1. I play instruments and am a saxophonist in the band THUMB. ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆ 
- Fun fact2. I enjoy sports and cats! 😄 My favorite movie is Interstellar (2014), directed by Christopher Nolan. The theme song "Cornfield Chase" is also one of my favorite piano pieces.
- Fun fact3. I have not attended the third year of high school. Although I was directly admitted to university through a physics competition in high school, I’m not exactly a big fan of physics now. (灬º‿º灬)♡
